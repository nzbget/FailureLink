# FailureLink
FailureLink script for [NZBGet](http://nzbget.net).

This script works with nzb indexers supporting HTTP header X-DNZB-FAILURE. If the download fails, the script informs the indexer about the failure and as response the indexer gives another nzb-file for the same title, which is queued then.

Ask your indexer's staff if the indexer supports X-DNZB-FAILURE header.

For support please visit forum topic [PP-Script FailureLink](http://nzbget.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1481).
